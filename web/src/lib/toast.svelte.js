// What the application has to say, said in one place.
//
// Before this there were two ways: alert(), which stops the page dead and
// looks like a browser rather than like Komodoc, and a line of text beside the
// save button that only the editor could use. A toast is neither: it appears,
// it is readable, and it goes.
//
// The store is Zag's, so a toast is announced to a screen reader, pauses on
// hover, and stacks with the others rather than replacing them.
