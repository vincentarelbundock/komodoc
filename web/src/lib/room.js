// The document's room: one socket carrying every comment on it, and the
// updates of whoever is editing it.
//
// A socket that drops loses nothing. Comments still post over the REST route,
// and the hello frame on reconnect resends the whole list, so a broadcast
// missed during the gap heals itself. What a drop does cost is seeing other
// people's comments as they arrive, which is worth saying -- but only once it
// has lasted longer than a blip, and only while it is true.
