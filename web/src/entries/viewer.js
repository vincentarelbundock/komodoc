// the empty HTML shell every other format gets: there is no HTML to paint.
// This page is that frame. It is served on the documents origin with the same
// CSP, the same `frame-ancestors` and the same agent as `serve_shell` gives a
// document, and it takes the same `preview` message the editor already sends
// on every recompile -- with `pdf` bytes where an HTML document has `html`.
//
// Nothing is drawn until a message arrives. A reader who opens this page
// directly is looking at a frame with no document in it, and it says so
// rather than sitting blank.
//
// pdf.js is loaded here and only here. The import is dynamic so the bytes
// are fetched on the first PDF and never by the reader shell, which has no
// use for them.
