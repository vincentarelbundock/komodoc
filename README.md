# Komodoc

Publish an HTML or Markdown document, share its unlisted link, and collect
comments and highlights in real time.

- Highlight passages, suggest edits, and comment on figures
- Multiple people can annotate simultaneously, with live updates
- Publish and manage documents from the web or CLI
- Trivial to deploy: one static binary, on your laptop or on a small server
- Free public sandbox for small, short-lived notebooks
- Allow anonymous comments or require GitHub authentication
- Export annotations as Markdown or W3C JSON-LD

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vincentarelbundock/komodoc/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer supports Linux and macOS. Windows binaries are available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/komodoc/releases).

## Web interface: Try it now!

The Komodoc sandbox is a free website where anyone can upload small (<4MB) short-lived (<24hrs) HTML or Markdown files. To upload a document, you will need to log with your Github username:

[Komodoc sandbox](https://komodoc.arelbundock.com)

If you do not want to log in but want to try annotating some documents, you can try one of these live examples:

- [Publication and management console](https://komodoc.arelbundock.com) (requires Github Login)

A published document lives at `/docs/<title>-<suffix>`, where the suffix is
random so the link cannot be guessed from the title. The seeded examples above
are the exception: their suffix is derived from the title rather than drawn at
random, so re-seeding the sandbox leaves these links pointing at the same
documents. That is safe only because an example is public on purpose; every
other document keeps an unguessable address. A link that resolves to nothing
gets a 404 page saying so.

<aside class="callout warning">
<strong>Warning:</strong> Do not publish confidential information on the Komodoc sandbox. Normally, documents are only visible to the person who uploaded them, or to people with the randomly generated and unlisted link. But if you are gathering comments on documents about national security, you should probably <a href="#self-managed-server">host your own instance</a> or find another solution.
</aside>

The standard web-based workflow is:

1. Open a Komodoc server in a browser, 
2. Sign in with GitHub (if the manager requires it), 
3. Upload an `.html` or `.md` file,
4. Send the (unlisted) link to your readers. 

anyone with the link can read the document. The Komodoc console only lists only the documents you own.

## CLI

Every command executed from the CLI must point to a specific Komodoc server. Typically, users will specify their server with a flag. For example, to make a request against the Komodoc sandbox, a live instance maintained by the developers, use:

```sh
komodoc <COMMAND> --server https://komodoc.arelbundock.com
```

When making repeated calls to the same server, it is convenient to specify the address using an [Environment Variable](#environment-variables). This allows us to omit the `--server` flag:

```sh
export KOMODOC_SERVER="https://komodoc.arelbundock.com"

komodoc <COMMAND>
```

In the examples below, we use the environment variables and omit the flag.

### Authenticate

Sign in once with GitHub using the device flow:

```sh
komodoc login
```

### Publish

Publish an HTML or Markdown document:

```sh
komodoc publish paper.html --title "My Paper"
```

HTML files must be self-contained, with images, styles, and fonts embedded. For
Quarto, render with:

```sh
quarto render paper.qmd --to html -M embed-resources:true
```

Publishing a file again, to a document that already exists, writes the file's
text into the live document and marks a checkpoint in its history. It never
conflicts with someone editing in the browser: their words and yours end up in
the same document, the way two browsers' do.

### List

List the documents visible to your account. Each row shows a short ID (at
least three characters, and the same width for every document) along with its
date and title. The ID is a prefix of the document's suffix, so a document
you publish again gets a new one; the seeded examples below keep theirs,
because their suffix is derived rather than random:

```sh
komodoc list
```

```

### Comment

Open a listed document in your browser for commenting. The ID is the one `list`
prints (a full slug also works):

```sh
komodoc comment c9k
```

### Edit

A document published from markdown or typst keeps that source, so it can be
edited in the page it is read in: the source on one side, the document as it will be
published on the other, and the comments beside both. Either of the two panes
next to the source folds away. `edit` takes the same ID `comment` does, and
just opens that page:

```sh
komodoc edit c9k
```

The editor is offered to whoever may replace the document, and the document
opens ready to work on. There is nothing to save: what is typed is the
document, readers see it a moment later, and the comments survive it — as you
type, they re-anchor against the edited text, and one whose passage is gone is
marked as needing re-anchoring rather than quietly dropped.

Several people can edit at once. The source is a CRDT (Yjs), so two people
typing in the same sentence converge without either waiting for the other, and
the toolbar says how many are in the session. The server holds the document,
relays every update and keeps the result, so closing the last tab loses nothing
and whoever opens the document next, in a browser or with `komodoc sync`, joins
what is there.

What is shared is the source. The preview is not: each browser renders what it
now has, so a session costs the deployment no CPU and no bandwidth beyond
relaying a few dozen bytes per keystroke.

History is kept for you. The server takes a checkpoint of the source when the
document has been quiet for a while, when the last editor leaves, when someone
comments, and whenever `komodoc publish` or `komodoc sync` writes to it; the
same text is never checkpointed twice. The timeline is behind the history
button in the toolbar and behind `komodoc history`: open any checkpoint, name
one, copy a link to it, or restore it. A restore is an edit, so nothing is ever
rewritten or lost.

Rendering happens in the browser, by the same compiler the command line
renders with, built for WebAssembly — for readers as much as for editors. The
deployment stores the source and nothing rendered from it, so what a reader
sees is by construction what the source says, and a live document costs the
deployment no CPU and no bandwidth beyond relaying a few dozen bytes per
keystroke.

Two formats, and they are not available in the same places:

| | Published with | Renderer | Over the wire |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Markdown** | `komodoc publish paper.md` | comrak | ~130 KB compressed |
| **Typst** | `komodoc publish paper.typ` | typst | ~13 MB compressed |

Both renderers are the same crate the binary itself renders with, compiled to
WebAssembly. Nothing else has to be installed: publishing a `.typ` file needs
no `typst` binary on your PATH, because the compiler is inside Komodoc, and it
is the same one the editor runs — so a document cannot render one way when it
is published and another way when it is edited.

The typst module is thirty megabytes, typst itself and the fonts it sets
documents in, so it is optional at build time and fetched only by someone who
opens a typst document. Both modules are fetched once and cached for a year.
Since nothing rendered is stored, a build without the typst module cannot show
a typst document at all, and refuses to create one rather than storing a source
nobody could read.

Typst's HTML export is still marked experimental upstream, so complex
documents may not survive it intact. Simple ones, including maths, come out as
real HTML with MathML, which is what lets comments anchor into them at all.

The typst renderer is built by `make typst`, which needs a Rust toolchain and
is deliberately not part of `make build`. Without it Komodoc builds and runs
exactly as before, and simply does not offer typst editing.

A document published as HTML is its own source: it is shown as it was
published and cannot be opened in the editor. One published before its source
was kept has none stored; publish it again from its markdown to make it
editable. The list on the landing page marks which is which.

### Storage

By default a server keeps everything in a directory:

```sh
komodoc serve --data ./komodoc-data
```

It can keep it in any S3-compatible bucket instead — R2, AWS, MinIO, Backblaze
— so a small server holds no durable state of its own and the bytes, the bill
and the ownership of the data are yours:

```sh
export KOMODOC_S3_ACCESS_KEY=...
export KOMODOC_S3_SECRET_KEY=...

komodoc serve --s3-endpoint https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com \
              --s3-bucket komodoc --s3-region auto
```

Credentials come from the environment by preference: a flag is visible to every
process on the machine and lands in your shell history, and komodoc says so if
you pass one.

Everything komodoc writes lives under one prefix (`komodoc/` by default,
`--s3-prefix` to change it), so a bucket can be shared and deleting a
document has a bounded blast radius. It never deletes the bucket, and never
touches a key outside its own prefix.

At startup the bucket is probed. The index is kept correct by conditional
writes, so a bucket that does not support them is refused rather than run on
quietly — pass `--single-writer` to assert that only this process writes
these keys, which is true of a single server, and it will use its own lock
instead. It is printed at startup either way.

Comments live in the bucket too (`rooms/<slug>.json`), written as they are
made. A second server pointed at the same bucket finds the room locked and
serves it read-only rather than interleaving its writes.

With `--s3-direct-reads`, a document's bytes are fetched by the reader's
browser straight from the bucket rather than passing through the server. That
needs a CORS rule on the bucket; the deployment prints the policy to paste.

### Export

Export annotations as readable Markdown. `export` takes the same ID `comment`
does, a short ID from `list`:

```sh
komodoc export c9k --format markdown --out comments.md
```

Without `--format markdown`, Komodoc exports W3C Web Annotation JSON-LD.

### Destroy

Delete one document, including its history and comments. It takes the same ID
`comment` and `export` do -- the short one from `list`, or a full slug -- and
asks you to type the full slug to confirm unless `--yes` is supplied:

```sh
komodoc destroy --document c9k
```

It deletes the document, its history and its comments. Nothing else on the
server is touched.

## Deploy

Komodoc is one static binary with everything compiled into it: the reader, the
renderers, and the server. Run it on your laptop for a quick trial, or on a
small host for something durable.

### Local

Run a public local instance with no GitHub setup at all:

```sh
komodoc serve --port 8081 --publishers YOUR-GITHUB-LOGIN
```

Open <http://localhost:8081>. Everything is stored in `komodoc-data` (see [Storage](#storage)).

### Self-managed server

Run the bundled server on your own host, with `--data` set to a persistent
directory:

```sh
komodoc serve --port 8080 --data /var/lib/komodoc --publishers YOUR-GITHUB-LOGIN
```

To let people sign in, set up a [GitHub app](#github-oauth) for this server's address.

Run the server behind a reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS, and have the proxy send the `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` header. That header is how the server knows its own address is an HTTPS one: without it the session cookie is not marked `Secure`, and uploads and comments are refused because the browser's idea of where the page came from does not match the server's. Plain HTTP is fine on `localhost` and nowhere else.

### Retention

Delete documents automatically after their most recent publication:

```sh
komodoc serve --expire-after 24h
```

For a fixed lifetime from the first upload, use `--expire-from created`. Use
`--expire-after never` to disable expiry. Expired documents are removed by an
hourly pass, and once at startup.

### Storage

`komodoc serve` keeps documents, comments and the session key in the directory
named by `--data` or `KOMODOC_DATA`, `komodoc-data` in the working directory by
default; back it up if the instance holds real work. Point it at a bucket
instead and the server holds nothing of its own — see
[Bring your own bucket](#bring-your-own-bucket).

Five flags bound what a deployment will store:

| Flag | Caps | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--max-size` | one document | 4 MB |
| `--quota` | everything one publisher holds | 100 MB |
| `--storage` | the whole deployment | 5120 MB |
| `--max-documents` | documents one publisher may hold | 50 |
| `--uploads-per-hour` | uploads one publisher may make in an hour | 30 |

```sh
komodoc serve --max-size 8 --quota 500 --storage 10240
```

Under `--publishers anyone` (see [Rights](#rights)), a browser's quota is tied
to a cookie rather than an account, so clearing cookies gets a new one;
`--storage` is the bound that actually holds under that policy.

### Rights

Two flags say who may do what.
`--publishers` says who may upload documents, and `--commenters` who may
annotate them. Both accept a comma-separated list of GitHub logins:

```sh
komodoc serve --publishers alice,bob --commenters anyone
```

Besides a list, each flag takes two keywords:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `alice,bob` | only these GitHub accounts |
| `any` | any signed-in GitHub account |
| `anyone` | no sign-in at all |

`--publishers` has no default: the server insists you say who may publish.
`anyone` is allowed, which is what makes the local trial above work without any
GitHub setup; on a host the internet can reach, name the accounts instead.
`--commenters` defaults to `anyone`,
so readers can annotate a document straight from its link; use `any` to
attribute every comment to a GitHub account, or a list to keep a draft among
named reviewers.

### GitHub OAuth

Komodoc signs people in with GitHub, so any server that asks anyone to sign in
needs an OAuth app of its own. A server where both `--publishers` and
`--commenters` are `anyone` never asks, and runs without one.

Create the app at [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)
(New OAuth App) with **Device Flow enabled**, which is what `komodoc login`
uses at the terminal. Point its two URLs at the server's own address — the
public HTTPS address it sits behind, with the same `/auth/callback` path:

```text
Homepage URL:               https://docs.example.org
Authorization callback URL: https://docs.example.org/auth/callback
```

Pass the credentials to `serve` through the environment, rather than as flags: an argument is visible in `ps` to every process on the machine,
an environment variable is not.

```sh
export KOMODOC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="..."
export KOMODOC_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
```

## Environment variables

[^github-data]: Komodoc requests no GitHub scopes through OAuth. It uses the
GitHub API only to obtain your public login name; it does not collect your email,
repositories, or other profile data.

Flags take precedence over their corresponding environment variables.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `KOMODOC_SERVER` | Default server for `login`, `publish`, `list`, `export`, and document deletion |
| `KOMODOC_TOKEN` | GitHub token to use instead of `komodoc login` |
| `KOMODOC_DATA` | Directory `serve` and `seed` use for documents and comments (default `komodoc-data`) |
| `KOMODOC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth app client ID |
| `KOMODOC_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth app client secret |
| `KOMODOC_PUBLISHERS` | GitHub accounts allowed to publish |
| `KOMODOC_COMMENTERS` | Who may comment: `anyone`, `any`, or a list of GitHub accounts |
| `KOMODOC_EXPIRE_AFTER` | Automatically delete documents after a duration such as `24h` or `30d` |
| `KOMODOC_EXPIRE_FROM` | Start retention at `updated` (default) or `created` |
| `KOMODOC_VERSION` | Version selected by the installer |
| `KOMODOC_BIN_DIR` | Installation directory selected by the installer |

## Building from source

Three builds go into one binary.

| | What it is | Built by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `engine/` | markdown and typst, rendered | cargo, natively and to WebAssembly |
| `web/` | the pages: Svelte, Skeleton, CodeMirror 6, Yjs | bun and vite |
| `komodoc/` | the server and the command line | cargo |

The engine is built twice — natively into the binary, and to WebAssembly for
the browser — so the editor's preview and the command line's output come from
the same code. The web build writes into `src/shell`, which the binary embeds;
nothing under that directory is edited by hand.

```sh
make web      # the pages, from web/
make wasm     # the markdown renderer for the browser (fast)
make typst    # the typst renderer, ~30 MB (slow, and optional)
make build    # dist/komodoc, with the pages and renderers embedded
make test     # rustfmt, clippy and the test suite
```

`make build` needs [bun](https://bun.sh) and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
(`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`). `make typst` is deliberately
separate: it takes a few minutes and adds thirty megabytes to the binary, and a
build without it works exactly as described above, minus typst editing.

### The look

The pages are [Skeleton](https://skeleton.dev) on Tailwind 4. Skeleton supplies
the furniture -- buttons, cards, inputs, tables, dialogs, tooltips, toasts --
and `web/src/styles/theme.css` colours all of it from Komodoc's own four
colours, so the palette is written down once and nowhere else.

Three rules keep a growing application looking like one application, and
`make test` enforces them:

1. A colour or a size comes from the theme. A hex value or an arbitrary
   Tailwind size in a component is a decision made twice.
2. A control is a component. There is one `IconButton`, so there cannot be a
   fourth kind of button that is almost like the other three.
3. Layout comes from `Page`, `Stack` and `Row`, so a new screen is assembled
   rather than measured.

Two things sit outside that system deliberately: the agent, which paints
highlights inside a document on another origin where none of this stylesheet
reaches it, and the colours identifying people in a shared editing session,
which travel over the wire to other browsers.

### The editor

The source is edited in CodeMirror 6, bound to a Yjs document. Two people
typing in the same sentence converge without either waiting for the other, each
keeps their own undo history, and each sees the other's caret where it actually
is, labelled with their name. The server relays those updates and applies them
to the copy it keeps, which is the document.

A reader who only reads fetches the page, its bundle and the Yjs document, and
renders it as it changes; CodeMirror is a separate bundle, fetched only when an
editor is actually opened.
