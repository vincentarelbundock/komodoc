//! Documents are served from a different hostname than the reader, so an
//! uploaded file is a stranger to the page framing it. The browser then refuses
//! it any access to the reader's DOM or its session, which is what lets the
//! document run its own scripts safely: charts, maps, anything.
//!
//! A different port would not do. Cookies ignore ports, so a document on
//! another port could still make requests carrying the reader's session. It
//! has to be a different host.
//!
//! The names are derived rather than configured: whatever host the reader is
//! on, documents live on "docs." in front of it. On a real domain that is one
//! DNS record and one certificate; in development, browsers resolve anything
//! ending in .localhost by themselves, so it needs no setup at all.
