# natively for the command line and as WebAssembly for the editor; the web app
# in web/ is Svelte, bundled by vite and installed by bun; komodoc embeds both
# and serves them.

# Local settings, kept out of the repository: the GitHub OAuth app and who may
# publish. Copy .env.example to .env and fill it in. Values are read as Make
# assignments, so write them bare, with no surrounding quotes.
